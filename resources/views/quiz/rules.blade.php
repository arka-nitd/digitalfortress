                    READ THE RULES VERY CAREFULLY.

                    1.) Each Round has two kinds of questions : Hints Question and Round Question.

                    2.) There will be around 4-6 Hints question per round and 1 Round Question.

                    3.) Solving an hint question will get you a latitude longitude position unlocked
                        which will be plotted in a google map.

                    4.) After you solve all the questions you will notice that there is a pattern formed 
                        in the map, which will be your clue. It maybe any kind of shape or correlation
                        between all the points in the map.

                    5.) All you need to do is zoom into the map or analyse the map or find details about that
                        location,decode the pattern or use all your detective ideas to find a clue. This clue
                        will help you to solve the main question of that round, solving which you proceed to the
                        next round.

                    6.) Each round will have a particular theme and questions will be based on that.

                    Note: It is always possible to not solve all the question of the round and directly solve the
                          round question and proceed to the next round. It all depends on your intelligence level.
                          But remember if you solve all the questions of the round only then you can notice the 
                          entire pattern in the google world map.

                        SO ENJOY YOUR RIDE ACROSS THE WORLD, EXPLORE PLACES, USE ALL FEATURES OF GOOGLE MAP AND TRY YOUR
                        BEST TO DECODE THE PATTERN. THE DIGITAL ARENA IS YOURS AND THE FORTRESS IS UNLOCKED.
                        ALL THE BEST !!
